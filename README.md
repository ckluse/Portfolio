This is a collection of my best data science assignments and projects.

<b> Springboard Assignments </b>

These are a collection of assignments that I worked on throughout Springboard's Data Science Career Track.

<b> Guided Capstone </b>

This is the first capstone in Springboard's Data Science Career Track. It is a guided capstone to give students a introduction to a real world data science problem. 

<b> Capstone 2 </b>

<i> Note: </i> This project is in process. This is my second capstone project for Springboard. I am building a book recommendation system with Goodreads data, using a 
user-based collaborative filtering technique.
